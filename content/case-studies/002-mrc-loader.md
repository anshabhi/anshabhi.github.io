title: AITOM GUI MRC Loader
excerpt: I developed this tool during my internship at Xu Labs, CMU to aid zooming into and slicing a tomograph model stored as a MRC file. The tool has Django backend and makes use of libraries such as VTK, mayavi and django2_resumable. The model can be either uploaded for exploration, or an existing model can be selected from the library.
